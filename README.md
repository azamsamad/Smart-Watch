# ⌚ Smart Watch Health Monitoring System (IoT)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Watch Health Monitoring System** is an Internet of Things (IoT) based wearable device designed to monitor a user's **heart rate in real time**.

The system uses IoT sensors integrated with a microcontroller to collect physiological data. The collected information is transmitted wirelessly and displayed on a **web application/mobile interface**, allowing users to monitor their health remotely.

This project demonstrates how wearable technology and IoT can work together to enable **smart healthcare**, **fitness tracking**, and **remote patient monitoring**.
